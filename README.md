# OpenGL-Motions-Of-A-Satellite

The solar system and its planets have been a mystery since a long time. Most of the people 
around the globe have many misconceptions about the planets, itâ€™s satellites and their motions 
such as rotation about its axis and revolution around the sun. The motions of satellites around a 
planet have also been shrouded in a cloud of mystery for many people. A satellite is any object 
that is orbiting the earth, sun or other massive body. Satellites can be categorized as natural 
satellites or man-made satellites. The moon, the planets and comets are examples of natural 
satellites. Accompanying the orbit of natural satellites are a host of satellites launched from earth 
for purposes of communication, scientific research, weather forecasting, intelligence, etc. 
 This project aims to simulate the different motions of a satellite around a planet. It also 
provides top view and bottom view for better understanding of retrograde motion and angled 
motion along with normal motions of a satellite. This will help the common user to understand 
the complex science behind satellite motions
